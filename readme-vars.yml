  The Webtop can be accessed at:

  * http://yourhost:3000/

  By default the user/pass is abc/abc, if you change your password or want to login manually to the GUI session for any reason use the following link:

  * http://yourhost:3000/?login=true

  You can access advanced features of the Guacamole remote desktop using ctrl+alt+shift enabling you to use remote copy/paste or an onscreen keyboard.

  **Unlike our other containers these Desktops are not designed to be upgraded by Docker, you will keep your home directoy but anything you installed system level will be lost if you upgrade an existing container. To keep packages up to date instead use Ubuntu's own apt program or Alpine's apk program**

  **The KDE and i3 flavors for Ubuntu need to be run in privileged mode to function properly**

  If you ever lose your password you can always reset it by execing into the container as root:
  ```
  docker exec -it webtop passwd abc
  ```
  By default we perform all logic for the abc user and we reccomend using that user only in the container, but new users can be added as long as there is a `startwm.sh` executable script in their home directory.
  All of these containers are configured with passwordless sudo, we make no efforts to secure or harden these containers and we do not reccomend ever publishing their ports to the public Internet.
